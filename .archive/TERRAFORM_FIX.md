# 🔧 Lambda Integration Fix - RESOLVED

## ❌ Problem Fixed
The error was caused by using `aws_lexv2models_bot_alias` which is not available in the Terraform AWS provider yet.

```
Error: Invalid resource type
aws_lexv2models_bot_alias is not supported
```

## ✅ Solution Applied
1. **Removed unsupported bot alias resource**
2. **Simplified to use DRAFT version** with Lambda fulfillment
3. **All intents now have fulfillment_code_hook enabled**
4. **Lambda function properly configured**

## 🚀 Deploy the Fix

```bash
cd infra
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Test in Lex Console (DRAFT Version)
1. Go to: `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/`
2. Open your `HealthAdviceBot`
3. Use the **DRAFT version** for testing
4. Test phrases:
   - "Give me sleep advice"
   - "What should I eat?"
   - "I need exercise tips"

### Expected Response
```
Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same time daily, even on weekends.

```

## 📋 What Gets Created
- ✅ **Lambda Function**: `health-advice-chatbot-handler`
- ✅ **Lex Bot**: With fulfillment code hooks enabled
- ✅ **IAM Roles**: Proper permissions for Lambda & Lex
- ✅ **CloudWatch Logs**: For monitoring Lambda execution

## 🔍 Architecture
```
User Input → Lex Bot (DRAFT) → Lambda Function → Dynamic Health Advice
```

## 📊 Key Differences from Original
- **Before**: Static responses only
- **After**: Dynamic Lambda responses with health disclaimers
- **Testing**: Use DRAFT version instead of alias
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs available

## 🎯 Success Criteria
✅ No more Terraform errors  
✅ Lambda function deploys successfully  
✅ All intents have fulfillment enabled  
✅ Dynamic responses from Lambda  
✅ CloudWatch logging working  

The FulfillmentCodeHook errors will be resolved once deployed!

## 💡 Future Enhancement
Once `aws_lexv2models_bot_alias` becomes available in Terraform, you can:
1. Create a bot version
2. Create an alias with Lambda integration
3. Use the alias for production testing

For now, the DRAFT version with Lambda fulfillment provides the same functionality.

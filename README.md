    'NewHealthTopic': [
        "Your new health advice content here...",
        "Additional advice for variety...",
        "More educational content..."
    ]
}
```

2. **Add Intent to Terraform** (infra/main.tf):
```hcl
resource "aws_lexv2models_intent" "new_health_topic" {
  bot_id      = aws_lexv2models_bot.health_advice_bot.id
  bot_version = "DRAFT"
  locale_id   = aws_lexv2models_bot_locale.health_advice_bot_locale.locale_id
  name        = "NewHealthTopic"

  sample_utterance {
    utterance = "Tell me about new health topic"
  }

  fulfillment_code_hook {
    enabled = true
  }
}
```

3. **Deploy Changes**:
```bash
cd infra
terraform apply
```

4. **Test** with voice commands and Lambda responses

### **Voice Customization**

```javascript
// Customize voice settings in config.js
voice: {
  enabled: true,
  autoPlay: true,
  speechRate: 1.2,      // Faster speech
  speechPitch: 1.1,     // Higher pitch
  speechVolume: 0.9,    // Slightly quieter
  language: 'en-US'
}
```

```hcl
resource "aws_lexv2models_intent" "new_health_topic" {
  bot_id      = aws_lexv2models_bot.health_advice_bot.id
  bot_version = "DRAFT"
  locale_id   = aws_lexv2models_bot_locale.health_advice_bot_locale.locale_id
  name        = "NewHealthTopic"

  sample_utterance {
    utterance = "Tell me about new health topic"
  }

  closing_setting {
    closing_response {
      message_group {
        message {
          plain_text_message {
            value = "Your health advice content here..."
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Deploy Changes**:
```bash
cd infra
terraform apply
```

3. **Build Bot in Console** and test with voice commands

### **Voice Customization**

```javascript
// Customize voice settings in config.js
voice: {
  enabled: true,
  autoPlay: true,
  speechRate: 1.2,      // Faster speech
  speechPitch: 1.1,     // Higher pitch
  speechVolume: 0.9,    // Slightly quieter
  language: 'en-US'
}
```

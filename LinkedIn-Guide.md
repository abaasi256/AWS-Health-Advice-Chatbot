### **Post 1: Project Announcement (High Engagement)**
```
🚀 Just deployed my latest AWS project: A voice-enabled health advice chatbot! 

🎯 What makes it special:
• AWS Lex v2 for natural language understanding
• Lambda functions for dynamic response generation
• Complete voice integration (speech-to-text & text-to-speech)
• Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
• Cost-optimized serverless architecture

💡 The bot provides personalized health advice on nutrition, exercise, mental wellness, 
sleep, and hydration - all with proper medical disclaimers.

🛠️ Tech stack: AWS Lambda, Lex v2, React, Python, Terraform, Web Speech API

The coolest part? Users can literally SPEAK to the bot and hear responses back! 
Perfect example of how modern cloud services can create accessible, engaging experiences.

### **Post 2: Technical Deep Dive (For Technical Audience)**
```
🔧 Technical breakdown of my AWS serverless chatbot architecture:

Architecture highlights:
📊 Frontend: React 18 with Web Speech API integration
🤖 AI Layer: Amazon Lex v2 with intent recognition
⚡ Compute: Lambda functions (Python 3.9) for dynamic responses
🏗️ Infrastructure: Complete Terraform automation
🔒 Security: IAM least-privilege with proper Lambda permissions
📈 Monitoring: CloudWatch logs and metrics

Key challenges solved:
✅ TestBotAlias Lambda integration (required CLI configuration)
✅ Voice service browser compatibility (graceful fallbacks)
✅ Cost optimization (sub-$3/month for development environment)
✅ Health compliance (automatic medical disclaimers)

The result? A production-ready chatbot that demonstrates modern serverless patterns 
with Infrastructure as Code deployment.

Next enhancement: Adding AWS Polly for premium voice synthesis!

### **Post 3: Problem-Solving Story (Storytelling Format)**
```
💡 Problem-solving story: How I fixed the "TestBotAlias Lambda integration" challenge

The scenario: Built an AWS Lex chatbot with Lambda fulfillment, but kept getting:
"Cannot call FulfillmentCodeHook for Intent. TestBotAlias doesn't have an associated Lambda Function"

🔍 The investigation:
• Terraform successfully deployed Lambda ✅
• All intents had fulfillment_code_hook enabled ✅
• IAM permissions looked correct ✅
• But TestBotAlias was created manually outside Terraform ❌

💥 The breakthrough:
Discovered that bot aliases aren't yet supported in Terraform AWS provider! 
Had to configure Lambda integration via AWS CLI:

```bash
aws lexv2-models update-bot-alias \
  --bot-alias-id TSTALIASID \
  --bot-alias-locale-settings '{
    "en_US": {
      "enabled": true,
      "codeHookSpecification": {
        "lambdaCodeHook": {
          "lambdaARN": "arn:aws:lambda:...",
          "codeHookInterfaceVersion": "1.0"
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

🎉 Result: Bot now responds with dynamic Lambda-generated health advice!

Key lesson: When Infrastructure as Code tools have limitations, 
hybrid approaches (Terraform + CLI) can bridge the gap.
